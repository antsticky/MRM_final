This approximation of the real world let us to use the Black-Scholes formulas for analytical calculations. But, one can also use numerical methods, e.g. Monte-Carlo with central estimator.

In this case, both, the exact and the numerical method can be compared by a direct calculation as well where the inaccruate of the MC is eye-catching in the case of the European Digital Call, but it gives a good proxy for European Call Option.

For the full theoretical background see [README.pdf](README.pdf) and for a short demo see `examples*.py`.
